3
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,208
Have you been abroad before?

4
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,375
No, it's my first time.

5
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,458
First time? And in Finland?
Not bad don't you think?

6
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,625
Yes.

7
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:04,250
Why do you deserve to be selected
for this scholarship?

8
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:13,166
Because I passed all the requirements.

9
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,250
Can I answer like this?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,458
Don't ask me.

11
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,166
Now, can you tell me about yourself?

12
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,416
Well then...

13
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,666
What do you know about Finland?

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,791
Well... I don't know but...

15
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,833
It's probably cold.

16
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:06,125
And why did you choose Finland?

17
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:15,750
I just picked anywhere
to get away from here.

18
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:20,000
Come on! Who would let you pass
with an answer like that?

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,750
But you told me to tell the truth.

20
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,666
I simply told you to be yourself.

21
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,458
Some truths don't have to be told, right?

22
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,625
So... be myself,

23
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,291
but don't say everything I think.

24
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,166
Okay.

25
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,541
Can we try again?

26
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,875
Sun, rice stick noodles
for table 7 is ready.

27
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,458
Check, please.

28
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,625
Table 7, here you go.

29
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,291
Uncle.

30
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,166
Good morning.

31
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,458
Hello Belle.

32
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,666
Hi. Thank you.

33
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,708
-So, have you told your dad?
-Yeah.

34
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,083
How was it?

35
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
Not good.

36
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,708
Don't worry.

37
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,416
You guys will be okay.

38
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,416
He's your father.

39
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,958
He'll forgive you anyway.

40
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,083
What did I do wrong?

41
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,333
Why would he have to forgive me?

42
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,375
Pook, what's up.

43
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,583
What the hell did you do to your hair?

44
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,375
C'mon, we've finished high school, dude.
Can I do what I want for just a bit?

45
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,583
I think it's too much.
Seriously, you like this style?

46
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,166
Not really, they messed it up.

47
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,083
I even showed the hairdresser a photo.

48
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,625
But she said my face wasn't right for it.

49
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,458
So she did this to me instead.

50
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,291
I was confused. It's my freakin' head!

51
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,541
Bad luck.

52
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,416
Why is everybody
here in this gaming place?

53
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,500
Don't they have homes to go back to?

54
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,375
Nobody wants to be home these days.

55
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,666
There's so much pressure
from their parents.

56
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,875
No, I know my results already.

57
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,583
What? That's quick.

58
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,333
Home Economics.

59
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,875
Wow, good for you. Congratulations!

60
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,083
Wait, since when did
you dig home economics?

61
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,375
Bitch, I'm not like Sue.

62
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,500
I can't even chop vegetables.

63
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,875
It's called strategy.

64
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,833
I had to choose something
easy that I was sure to get into.

65
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,583
If I didn't have a place to study
my parents would give me hell.

66
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,125
Bummer!

67
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,875
Now I'm the only one who has
to wait for the next round?

68
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,791
What about you?

69
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,458
Going all the way to Finland?

70
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,375
Yeah...

71
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,875
That's why I'm here.
You've gone abroad before, right?

72
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,500
Tell me how to prepare.

73
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,291
Well, my only international trip is...

74
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,833
Poipet.

75
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,125
Does that count?

76
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,958
Poipet, where is that?

77
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,750
Damn.

78
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,875
Where is it?

79
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,291
There!

80
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,625
They only have...

81
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,958
May I help you?

82
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,083
Prateep?

83
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,000
You work here?

84
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,458
Miss, how many days
are you going abroad for?

85
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,250
So I can recommend a proper size.

86
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,125
How many days...

87
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,625
How the hell would I know?

88
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,750
Actually...

89
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,708
The pattern sucks.

90
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,708
Whatever.

91
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
It's all I could afford anyway.

92
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,291
Better save money for Finland.

93
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,583
I didn't know suitcases
are this expensive.

94
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,541
Actually, I think the prices are normal.

95
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,333
I had no idea.

96
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,750
Then it must be durable. Can I go faster?

97
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,000
I guess.

98
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,208
Fuck!

99
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,041
Sue, where are you going?

100
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,041
Tips for packing a suitcase.

101
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,125
Tips? Really?

102
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,416
One website at a time, would you?

103
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,791
I'm clicking them all just in case.

104
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,958
Wow, that's quite a list.

105
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,541
First,

106
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,833
universal adaptor.

107
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,250
What is that?

108
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,958
Is this one universal?

109
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,875
Do you know the difference?

110
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,916
A passport.

111
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,750
Ouch! My foot!

112
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,625
You move over!

113
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,041
What?

114
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,250
You look so dorky!

115
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,583
I took it before my mom died.

116
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,416
Little Sue.

117
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,583
Yes, that's me.

118
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,666
Okay.

119
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,666
Wow.

120
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,750
Put that away.

121
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,708
No, let me take a look at it first.
I've never had one yet.

122
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,125
Aloe vera.

123
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,250
For sunburn?

124
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,916
USB Hub.

125
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,750
For charging stuff.

126
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,333
Toss it here.

127
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,041
It's very old.

128
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,958
Ziplock bags.

129
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
Where did I put it?

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,291
-Two sizes.
-Shit!

131
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,416
TSA Lock.

132
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,583
There isn't any information here.

133
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,458
Try another website.

134
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,875
I don't know what it is either.

135
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,416
Is it read ta-sa?

136
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,750
Ta-sa my ass.

137
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,666
Ah, I see.

138
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,583
Wet tissue.

139
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,250
This is extremely important,

140
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,708
because normal tissues
will make your butt itch.

141
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,500
CONDOMS

142
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,458
***THEIR SIZES AREN'T THE SAME AS OURS

143
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,416
I don't think I can finish it.

144
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,166
Let's do it this way.

145
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,583
It's simple.

146
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,750
Pile all your belongings
in the middle of the room.

147
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:34,333
then pick only what you need
and ditch what you don't.

148
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,583
Simple.

149
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,333
You aren't helping me at all.

150
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,791
You're just reading cartoons.

151
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,708
Return it to Yok for me then.

152
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,875
Hey. I've got an idea.

153
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,250
-What?
-Let's make a checklist.

154
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,041
Sanitary napkins, too...

155
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,666
Yeah, and menstrual cramps pills.

156
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:18,625
-Maybe they will have those there.
-But I don't know what it's called.

157
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't forget to group them. What you
already have and what you need to buy.

158
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:29,333
-Now you draw a dead me.
-I draw you! It looks exactly like you.

159
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,041
I don't have space to write
because of your drawings.

160
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,833
I'm gonna decorate this
some more for you.

161
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,583
Shut up, my drawings look good.

162
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,166
I can't really make it out.
It looks like a dead person.

163
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,750
-I'll do it myself.
-You wrote on me!

164
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,291
-See? You're doing it, too.
-But I'm better at it than you are.

165
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,541
-Because I'm good at this and you're not.
-No.

166
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,000
-Get outta here!
-What the hell is that supposed to be?

167
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,500
Is that everything?

168
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,000
Only ten things?

169
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,958
But I think that's enough. I'm tired.

170
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Anyone?

171
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,166
I think it's not fair to blame Jenny.

172
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,625
Nowadays, acting talent is useless
if you are ugly.

173
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,916
But it's the talk of the town
because her ex feels like she fooled him.

174
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They feel the face they love
is not real, it's fake. Right?

175
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,083
Yes.

176
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,958
That's why she had to lie.

177
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,083
People can't accept the truth,
but it's her face.

178
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,000
She didn't kill anyone.

179
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,000
So... how about you?

180
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,458
Would you want to try a makeover
if you get the chance?

181
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,958
Do you want a new face?

182
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,541
Of course. I wanna go to Korea.

183
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,250
I'm gonna be a Korean girl.

184
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,916
If I had a new face, I'd have a new life.

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,166
And I can flirt with anybody.

186
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,166
I can be a bitch.

187
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,833
All right. Okay, okay.

188
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,125
So, you finally passed?

189
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:19,375
You have to take these extra documents
to their office in Bangkok.

190
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,208
Can I just send them by e-mail?

191
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,541
Nope. You'll have to have
your interview there as well.

192
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,083
How's it going? Have you practiced at all?

193
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,458
It would do you good
to find some information about Finland.

194
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,166
Are you excited?

195
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,250
Not really.

196
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,250
Really? You're not nervous at all?

197
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,125
I usually watch

198
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,458
videos on YouTube and...

199
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,791
Also tons of foreign movies.

200
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,750
I really don't think
it's going to be the same.

201
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,000
You know,

202
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,041
When I traveled for the first time...
I was terrified.

203
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,916
-No way!
-It's true!

204
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,916
Even now,
I still get nervous when I travel.

205
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:23,125
But you have been to so many, many places.

206
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,583
Have you ever sat on a plane before?

207
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,625
I hate airplanes.

208
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,250
Every time I decide to stay somewhere
it's when the plane is landing.

209
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:46,250
On the outside is a land unfamiliar to us.

210
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,916
It greets us with
a booing and threatening sound.

211
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,250
Wherever we go, it's always the same.

212
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,333
Do you miss Germany?

213
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,791
I'm never going back there.

214
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:57,708
Set prac...praactice

215
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,708
Thank you.

216
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,750
Hello.

217
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,750
Good luck.

218
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,708
Did he say he loves me?

219
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,458
That Sue. Thought
she'd never return them in this life.

220
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,750
Yeah.

221
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,416
That's why she asked me
to return them instead.

222
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,875
Check out those giant boobies!
Why did they have to cover them up?

223
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,833
What the hell are you doing?

224
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,958
You have to buy the magazines!
I'll spank you!

225
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,541
Let's get outta here.

226
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,416
Dumping my magazines again.

227
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,500
Whoa! Big boobs!

228
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,875
-Perverted brats!
-My boobs are big?

229
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,208
So, will you pay late fees for Sue, too?

230
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,958
Nah...

231
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,125
Okay, what is it?

232
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,958
Nothing, really.

233
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,541
Just... What to to about our band?

234
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,083
What's there to do?

235
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,125
I've sent a message into the
chat group and zero response.

236
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,958
Dead silent. What do you want me to do?

237
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,291
Sue told me that...

238
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,125
She wants to see us play again.

239
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:10,000
How about this.
On Sunday, you go to mass at church.

240
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,416
Prae and Pahn
will be there to perform anyway.

241
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,875
But the problem is,
they still don't talk to each other.

242
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,208
And what the hell's wrong with you?
Always doing what she tells you to.

243
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,041
Returning books for her.

244
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,916
Regrouping the band for her.

245
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,958
Seriously, are you her
friend or her errand boy?

246
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,208
Do you know she's leaving soon?

247
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,666
So what?
She'll be back before you know it.

248
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,916
Welcome, have a look.

249
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,166
Do you want my dad's style?

250
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,791
They all look the same to me.

251
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:26,166
The darker ones will be
easier to take care of.

252
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,958
Find anything?

253
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,125
MRI SCAN

254
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,291
Be careful, the pavement is uneven.

255
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:04,625
This way, slowly. Be careful not to fall.

256
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:17,041
Do you remember my friend, Sue?
She's sitting outside.

257
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,041
Let me comb your hair.

258
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,916
Get your hair out of your face.

259
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:46,958
That's me. Was I pretty, Grandma?

260
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,541
No.

261
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,125
Hey!

262
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:56,791
These are your wedding photos.
How come you're not smiling?

263
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:05,666
My dad told me to find a part-time job
while waiting for the exam results.

264
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,208
But I prefer to take care of Grandma.

265
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:16,875
I don't know how much
longer she'll be with us.

266
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,583
Do you think I can take care of
her without having a job?

267
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,375
Taking care of her
is more of a job than anything else.

268
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,708
Mr. Karn is handsome...

269
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,708
Here we go again.

270
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,208
Mr. Karn lived in that house over there.

271
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:10,333
We saw each other every day,
but we never talked.

272
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,125
<i>He kissed me.</i>

273
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,541
Promise me.
You will be here tomorrow same time.

274
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,708
Promise me.

275
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,583
<i>I promised.</i>

276
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,791
But he never came back.

277
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,000
The Legend of Mr. Boob Grab.

278
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,958
Who is Mr. Karn?

279
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,958
Your grandfather?

280
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,208
Hell no.

281
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,041
He liked to grab boobs.

282
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,166
His hands were so soft...

283
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:29,750
Mom. No, no, you shouldn't do that.

284
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,500
-It's embarrassing!
-It's my boob! I want to touch it!

285
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:35,916
-Stop it, Mom!
-Leave me! It's my boob!

286
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,625
No, the kids are here...

287
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:52,833
So, the scholarship that we give

288
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:56,791
Will cover the tuition fee
and accommodation fee.

289
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,500
However,

290
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,416
The cost of living there
is still quite expensive.

291
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,958
Do you think that
you will be able to handle that?

292
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,875
What skill or special talent do you have?

293
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:29,708
In case we can find a part time job
for you while you're studying.

294
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,708
Are we doing an interview right now?

295
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,625
Not really.

296
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,291
But, the way it is...

297
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:46,416
That's a direct question
that I'm asking you.

298
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,916
I can answer bluntly, right?

299
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:02,000
Other than English,

300
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:07,000
the only thing I'm good at is...

301
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,750
Cooking noodles.

302
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:17,625
Would you like
to open a noodle shop in Finland?

303
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,875
Yes, maybe.

304
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:28,708
As for your study there,
do you have a goal or a dream?

305
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:37,875
I don't have a dream yet.

306
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:51,041
Is getting away from here
considered a dream?

307
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,166
I mean,

308
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,083
If I don't go,
I will not know what my dream is.

309
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:14,000
But I think that if I go to Finland,

310
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:18,000
which has the best education in the world,

311
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:22,208
It might help me to find my dream easier.

312
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,750
You have some missing documents.

313
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,708
You need a signed testimonial
from your parents.

314
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,208
But I'm already 18.

315
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:54,625
Technically,
I don't need a signature from parents.

316
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:59,083
You're only 18, of course you need it.

317
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,916
But 18-year-olds have the right to vote.

318
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,916
Have you voted before?

319
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:19,333
Okay, you can send it to me by e-mail.

320
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:23,166
As long as it's before the deadline.

321
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:39,333
Why does it look so little
in foreign currency? Only a few thousand.

322
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,750
Is this the place they say
the milk tea is good?

323
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,125
How would I know?

324
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,916
-This one!
-Cute! What's that?

325
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,375
-Egg yolk?
-Ice-cream?

326
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,583
I don't know. Anything is fine.

327
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,250
You want one?

328
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,125
No way.

329
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:19,916
-A small one won't hurt so much.
-So? It's still going to hurt.

330
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,125
Those pants are cool.

331
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:31,458
I'm going to get them.

332
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:37,375
The ad says to be yourself,
so why would you imitate them?

333
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:41,625
You have to find your own kind of pants.

334
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,375
Shit, that's too deep.

335
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,583
Hello!

336
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,041
Hello, Belle!

337
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,666
Hi, honey! Belle.

338
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,208
What have you been up to?

339
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,750
-Hello
-Hi, Sue!

340
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,500
You're so beautiful
I don't even recognize you! Gee, I'm old.

341
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,541
Sue, you're doing well?

342
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,291
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,250
And you, sweetie?

344
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,250
Kinda... okay.

345
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,625
How about your entrance exam?
I can't wait to hear about the results!

346
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,666
If you get a seat in Bangkok,
will you come and stay with me?

347
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,750
Sue, I heard you're going to Finland?

348
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:54,666
Yes...

349
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,083
Aw, what a smart girl.

350
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,458
Does your scholarship cover accommodation?

351
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:02,500
I think so, but I have to pay for
miscellaneous expenses myself.

352
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:09,333
Super! Belle, do you want to go like Sue?

353
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,666
But I think English
is also very important.

354
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,791
How about this,

355
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:21,083
I'll pay Sue to be your English
tutor while she's still in Thailand.

356
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,333
What did you say?

357
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,250
Sounds good?

358
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:28,416
You guys just speak to each other
in English. It's perfect!

359
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,041
I don't think it's a good idea.

360
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,333
You don't?

361
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,041
Okay, let's order something.

362
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:41,916
This is the food menu, the drinks menu
and this is the Italian food menu.

363
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,291
Thank you.

364
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,375
Go ahead and order anything you want.

365
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,500
Can I have the shrimp fried rice please?

366
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,166
Make it two, please.

367
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,791
You think that's a good idea?
How about I order for you.

368
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,500
Let me see...

369
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,500
We'll have the signature lobster,

370
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,458
And Caesar salad

371
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,083
And Parma ham pizza, please.

372
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:50,250
Belle, this is so cute. Try it out.
You like it?

373
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,125
Seems like you don't. How about this one?

374
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,875
Your jean jacket is a little too boyish.

375
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:00,375
I think this one is better. Very pretty.

376
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,916
Let's put them in the trunk. Let's go.

377
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:11,875
-Belle, why don't you come sit with me?
-I want to sit with Sue in the back.

378
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,625
I can't believe today is almost over.

379
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:18,625
Is my driving okay? Smooth enough?

380
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,791
Do you have fun hanging with me?

381
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:27,083
You want to sleep, to talk
or watch TV in the car?

382
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,166
I don't usually talk much...

383
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,125
Yeah?

384
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:38,125
Let's get more snacks for the two of you.

385
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,250
Belle, take good care of yourself, okay?

386
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,583
Don't worry.

387
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,583
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

388
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,458
My sweet girl. Belle.

389
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,291
Bye.

390
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,708
I hate it.

391
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:04,041
<i>Don't you want to go live</i>
<i>with your mom in Bangkok?</i>

392
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,458
<i>No.</i>

393
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,916
<i>I'll probably be... uncomfortable.</i>

394
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:15,291
<i>And if I do,</i>
<i>who will help my dad take care of Grandma?</i>

395
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,333
<i>I don't want to be like my mom.</i>

396
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:31,958
<i>I don't want to end up</i>
<i>like your grandma either.</i>

397
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:51,083
HOME

398
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:50,375
<i>Ready to help those with weary hearts</i>

399
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:56,583
<i>Return to His kindness</i>

400
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:59,583
<i>Surrender your life to His Grace</i>

401
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,625
Look at them.

402
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,958
They're not even looking at each other.

403
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:07,916
<i>Believe in the Lord.</i>
<i>Take comfort in his solace</i>

404
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,166
<i>He's the rock of your life</i>

405
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,625
Maybe, they both have a crush on Tong?

406
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:20,041
<i>He is the Lord. He is the strength</i>

407
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:24,208
<i>See the world as our...</i>

408
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,250
Hey, isn't that Mr. Choke?

409
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,000
Right.

410
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,583
Why did he attend mass?
Isn't he a Buddhist?

411
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:43,541
Buddhists, Christians,
everybody prays here these days.

412
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,791
You really want our gang to
split up while still holding grudges?

413
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:55,791
The one who holds a grudge is Pahn,
not me.

414
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,666
The other day my mom lost her ring,
so she made a vow here.

415
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,583
She eventually found it.

416
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:07,166
She fulfilled her vow
by presenting a giant bouquet of flowers.

417
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:11,208
So if you're worried about anything,
try praying to God.

418
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,375
Sue is going to leave soon.

419
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,375
Let's play for her.
We've got nothing to lose.

420
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,666
Why do we have to play for her?

421
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,291
And why the hell not?

422
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:30,875
If I make a wish and get what I want,
does that mean I have to come back here?

423
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:36,666
Why? You're not planning to come back?

424
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:42,083
Don't fret over it.
Sue's not even in the band.

425
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:49,250
Even though she's not in the band,
but she did bring all of us together.

426
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,833
If it wasn't for me,
this band wouldn't have been formed.

427
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,250
Well, the band isn't making it anyway!

428
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,458
That's a shame. You two were best friends.

429
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,208
You're so nosy.

430
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,291
I'm just sayin'.

431
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,833
Can I ask you honestly?

432
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:12,750
What went wrong between you and Prae?

433
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:15,666
Is it about Tong?

434
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:17,875
Not your business.

435
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,875
You and Mew stopped talking
to each other for two years,

436
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,500
and I never stuck my
nose in to ask any questions.

437
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,791
You guys wait here.

438
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,916
So, which one do you like? Pick one.

439
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,666
You give them hope.
You've turned best friends into enemies.

440
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:58,250
Yeah, you gotta pick one.

441
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,250
I don't like either of them.

442
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:11,000
Yes.

443
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,041
We're waiting for you.

444
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,250
You should have called me up earlier.

445
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,541
Now the band's complete!

446
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:10,833
Stratosphere is back
and ready to kick ass!

447
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:14,333
I really want to know who the fuck
gave the band that name.

448
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:17,166
-This one. In front of you.
-Yes, me.

449
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:22,500
No wonder we don't become famous.
That name is such a mouthful.

450
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,458
Don't blame me! I love the band so much
I gave it such a beautiful name.

451
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:30,375
It was well thought through
and has a deep meaning.

452
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,791
What is it?

453
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:36,666
Stratosphere is the last layer
of the Earth's atmosphere

454
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,458
-Where humans can breathe.
-Hey!

455
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,250
Is that Mew?

456
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:47,958
Mew.

457
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:50,041
Hey, guys.

458
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,666
You're working here?

459
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,833
Yes.

460
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:01,208
That's our table. Over there.
We're all here

461
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,333
So how are you guys doing?

462
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:08,666
-We're fine. You?
-Like you see here.

463
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:13,083
Wow, you look so sexy in this outfit.

464
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,500
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

465
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,375
-One more time?
-Okay.

466
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:11,708
My bad again. Guess I'm hungry.

467
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,875
-What does that have to do with anything?
-I want chicken with sticky rice.

468
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,375
-Do you know where we can find it?
-At the entrance to our street?

469
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,875
-Let's go.
-Sounds good.

470
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:25,125
If you guys are not going to take it
seriously, I say we should quit.

471
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,416
Pahn, chill out.

472
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,625
No, I won't.

473
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:36,458
The reason this band is goin' nowhere
is because no one takes it seriously.

474
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,583
Honestly, I never believed
we'd pull this off.

475
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:45,458
Playing drums in your tank top and you
expect anyone to care about your music?

476
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:47,666
They'll only come to check out
your little rack.

477
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,083
Bitch, you've crossed the line.

478
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,833
But it's true.

479
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,416
-Why? Do my little boobs bother you?
-Yes, they do.

480
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,791
Hey, don't get worked up on this.

481
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:01,875
Why do you always treat your friends
like this? What do you want from us?

482
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,250
Nothing.

483
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:08,166
I had to sneak out and now this!

484
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,375
So why don't you
start taking it seriously?

485
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:11,666
Told you I'm starving!

486
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,333
Sue, where are you going?

487
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,875
We're all here because you wanted this!

488
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,708
Bitches, I'm outta here.

489
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,250
Go on, get out of here.

490
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,875
I will!

491
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,833
What's it going to be, Dad?

492
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,458
You're not going to sign it?

493
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,291
Sue...

494
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:01,458
Don't you want to
continue your dad's business?

495
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,791
I can't imagine myself doing that.

496
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:11,375
But I'm sure you can without much effort.

497
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,666
And why does she have to do it?

498
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,583
Why is it her burden to bear.

499
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:22,541
Has any of you ever even asked her
if she really wants to do it?

500
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,166
And how would you know!

501
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,750
Of course I know!

502
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:32,791
She told me hates the smell of noodles
that's always on her clothes.

503
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,666
Belle, that's enough!

504
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,083
You have to continue your family's legacy.

505
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:46,583
It's a cultural heritage of our town,
this herbal pork noodle.

506
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,458
Didn't you hear what I just said?

507
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,875
Keep the stupid heritage to yourself!

508
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:54,666
I said enough!

509
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,375
What the hell is wrong with you?

510
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm defending you here.

511
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,208
You don't have to speak up for me
all the time.

512
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:08,125
You think I'm intruding?

513
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:10,375
I'm on your side.

514
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,666
We're not that close
that you can speak for me.

515
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:21,291
So I have to be as close to you as Mew
to speak for you?

516
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,375
That's too much.

517
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,916
I can't even mention her name.

518
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:31,375
I know you only want me as her substitute.

519
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,708
Bitch,

520
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,750
You're talking rubbish now.

521
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,375
Then explain it to me!

522
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,666
Who the fuck do you think you are?

523
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,791
Everyone was there last night. For who?

524
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,916
So what? It didn't work out anyway!

525
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:52,375
You think you're a fucking princess

526
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:57,166
that everyone has to put up
with your shit all the time?

527
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,541
And what are you going to do about it?

528
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:02,000
Leave me alone then!

529
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:04,833
You don't have
to fucking come help me pack.

530
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,291
I don't want to see your face anymore.

531
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:09,833
Fine.

532
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,583
Go wherever the hell you want to go.

533
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,875
You're not planning to
come back anyway, right?

534
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,083
Eat shit!

535
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,958
Asshole.

536
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:11,041
Sis.

537
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,625
Next time you're going to blow a steam,
give us a warning first.

538
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,333
So we can take precautions for the shop.

539
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,041
Does this look like his signature?

540
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,416
Here.

541
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:03,708
I bought this for you.

542
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:08,958
Do you think I'm that kinky?

543
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:17,500
Wow, thank you.

544
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:30,250
These also. You sneaked in to try them on
all the time, right?

545
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:33,416
For real?

546
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,458
Yeah.

547
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,583
Are you happy that I'm leaving?

548
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,083
Not so fast.

549
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,250
Do you think you have the final say?

550
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,500
No, too much fat.

551
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:47,750
I'll choose it myself.
I'm usually the one to do it anyway.

552
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:57,333
What the hell? What do you want me to do?

553
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:02,541
What I'm doing right now,
I'm doing it for you.

554
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,041
So will you at least let me pick
a piece of meat by myself?

555
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,583
I pick the good pieces,
so what's your problem?

556
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,250
Why are you here today exactly?

557
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,708
To stop me from going to Finland?

558
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,083
Yes.

559
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:23,291
You know more about this meat than
about that entire shit country.

560
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:29,375
Because I only know about this shit meat,
I've never learned about anything else!

561
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,416
Make it good, Sun.

562
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,583
Don't mess it up.

563
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,208
You'll look like a mess
if you keep complaining.

564
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,166
What did you do to Dad again?

565
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:15,708
Well...

566
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:20,208
He got so mad he almost slapped me
in front of everyone in the market.

567
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:21,958
What?

568
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:25,458
I saw him come back
and just sits there sulking in his room.

569
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,416
This isn't what you call angry.

570
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,375
Seriously, Sun.

571
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,416
Are you sure you can
take care of the shop?

572
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:50,416
Seriously?

573
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,791
Well, I don't know.

574
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,083
But once you're gone,
it won't be your problem anymore.

575
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:04,541
<i>Please welcome our trainers.</i>

576
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,291
OASIS SEA WORLD

577
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,625
I've already heard.

578
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:39,208
What took you so long to tell me?

579
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:44,333
Just save the best for last.

580
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,416
My exam results are out, too.

581
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:56,625
I got into Fisheries at a university here.

582
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:02,083
That's awesome. No surprise there.

583
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:04,291
You're smart.

584
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:07,000
You helped me with math.

585
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:11,791
So I've helped you all the way to Finland.

586
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,791
Cool, you can train dolphins.

587
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,875
Yeah.

588
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,541
Seems like it's my calling.

589
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:53,666
They are not tamed
right at the beginning, right?

590
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:00,541
You mean dolphins?

591
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:05,208
Just give them a lot of food,
show them a lot of love.

592
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:08,833
Build mutual trust,
and they'll listen to you.

593
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:15,541
You're very good
when it comes to dolphins.

594
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:38,166
I'm sorry I won't be around anymore.

595
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,000
It's okay.

596
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:48,083
It's a great opportunity.

597
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:00,875
That day... we went a bit too far.

598
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,958
But I really feel that way.

599
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,791
I know.

600
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:44,958
Too bad, we'll never know
what will become of it...

601
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,833
Do you really have to go?

602
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,458
Why should I stay here?

603
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:08,291
Why not just leave...

604
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:11,083
to be somewhere, anywhere.

605
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:16,000
I don't know any other places.

606
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:19,208
And it's good enough for me here.

607
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,500
Is it not good enough for you, Sue?

608
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,708
I don't know.

609
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:31,833
It probably is good enough.

610
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:49,875
If you feed them enough...

611
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,625
Show them lots of love...

612
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,375
They'll do what you want, right?

613
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,166
The dolphins, I mean.

614
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,125
Hey...

615
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:26,083
Let's talk.

616
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:38,916
Come on. Let's talk properly.

617
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,708
How long are you
going to let me talk to myself?

618
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:08,750
Come on.

619
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,375
People will think I'm crazy,
talking to myself in front of a fridge.

620
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:24,958
It's lonely, packing by myself.

621
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,750
Come back and help me.

622
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:36,291
Do it yourself.

623
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:41,500
I won't intrude again.

624
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,458
You've always been this touchy.

625
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:05,333
Are you really here to make up?

626
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:40,916
I'm here to meet Sue.

627
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:47,791
She's lost a document so
I'm bringing her a new copy.

628
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,375
I'm meeting Sue here as well!

629
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:52,666
Me too!

630
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,208
Where is she now?

631
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,500
May I sit here with you?

632
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:04,375
Okay. Please sit.

633
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,625
Do you want to eat something?

634
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,458
What would you like?

635
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,750
I like...

636
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,333
White men...

637
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:45,541
-This is also delicious. It's recommended.
-All right

638
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:13,916
Happy now?

639
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,666
He will give me a discount for his class.

640
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:24,166
But you don't plan to go anywhere,
why study English?

641
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,666
To become his wife.

642
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:29,250
Slut.

643
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,750
It's beautiful.

644
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:04,958
Whose song?

645
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,083
I wrote it myself.

646
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,416
Really?

647
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:16,708
I like it.

648
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,791
I wrote it for you.

649
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,666
Just because you set me up,
doesn't mean I'm still not mad at you.

650
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,916
You're too much.

651
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,583
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

652
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,666
I'm not interested. Thank you.

653
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,750
Auntie, do you have a minute?

654
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:54,000
Why did you bring me here?

655
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,625
Wait.

656
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,750
You told me you wanted to
clear things with her.

657
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,000
Tell me honestly...

658
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:07,458
why did you two fight?

659
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:11,166
You guys were so close.

660
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:14,583
Even closer than me.

661
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:19,375
It was some dumb shit.

662
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,125
I'm listening.

663
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,000
Do you have to know everything?

664
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:38,125
Why is everyone calling me
nosy these days?

665
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:42,791
Okay.

666
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:44,666
Thank you.

667
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,791
Are you running away from a customer?

668
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm going to study abroad.

669
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,875
You've heard, right?

670
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,541
I miss the time when we were friends.

671
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:30,208
When I saw other friends greeting you,

672
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:35,375
hanging out with you.

673
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:43,333
I feel empty.

674
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:47,666
Like I'm invisible. Like I don't exist.

675
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:55,958
And I hate that feeling.

676
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,750
I'm tired of ignoring you.

677
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,750
Avoiding you.

678
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,875
What can I do to make things better?

679
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,541
I really don't know

680
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,041
what I did wrong.

681
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,041
But I'm here to apologize to you.

682
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,625
Are you done?

683
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:39,333
That day... I shouldn't have told
anybody about your...

684
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:52,291
And I even left you alone.

685
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:01,125
You used to be my best friend.

686
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:05,583
Hey!

687
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:09,458
She came all the way here to talk to you!
Why are you being so rude!

688
01:20:10,541 --> 01:20:11,750
Fuck off!

689
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:13,958
Fuck you!

690
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,291
Stop it!

691
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:06,708
I shouldn't have meddled
with your problems.

692
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:13,875
Everything is a mess.

693
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,458
It's not your fault.

694
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,166
One night I had a dream.

695
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:43,708
In the dream I was talking to Mew.

696
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:48,250
Talking like nothing
had happened between us.

697
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:54,041
But it was really strange.

698
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:59,875
Like I was aware
that it was definitely a dream.

699
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,541
And when I realized that,

700
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:11,000
I knew it will never happen in real life.

701
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,791
I cried like a baby.

702
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:21,333
Like a crazy person.

703
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,625
Then everything around me...

704
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,166
Everyone...

705
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:42,875
Started to fade away.

706
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:49,625
Leaving me alone in the dark world.

707
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:06,000
Everything I thought I
had wasn't mine at all.

708
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:30,833
I wasn't even in there?

709
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:38,416
It's just a dream.

710
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,291
Don't read too much into it.

711
01:23:49,041 --> 01:23:51,666
Sometimes I don't understand you.

712
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:59,750
You always keep your distance.

713
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,000
I tried to be a part of your life

714
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:11,166
but you don't let me in.

715
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:16,958
And it really makes me sad,

716
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,916
that I can't understand you.

717
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,916
Like I'm a shitty friend.

718
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:03,333
None of this is your fault.

719
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:28,083
I'm sorry, Belle.

720
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,125
That this is the best I can do.

721
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:26,833
<i>You are not the owner of you own life.</i>

722
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:33,291
<i>You are also not the owner of the breath</i>
<i>that goes in and out of your nostrils.</i>

723
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:40,875
<i>Everywhere gives you</i>
<i>a sense of familiarity and takes it back.</i>

724
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,958
<i>Everyone makes you believe what is right</i>

725
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:50,500
<i>and will turn you away,</i>
<i>just like you do unto others.</i>

726
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:04,375
Whose is this?

727
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,500
Don't know.

728
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,166
Maybe my mom's.

729
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:22,833
Your mom read this kind of stuff?

730
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,708
Hmm.

731
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:34,708
My mom was sometimes so eccentric.

732
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:39,750
I still don't get why
she ended up marrying Dad.

733
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:56,833
She kept saying
that my dad gave up too easily.

734
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,583
I don't understand.

735
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:14,500
Is life meant to be this sad?

736
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,416
Do you want to take this with you?

737
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:04,916
What if I suddenly change my mind

738
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,375
and cancel everything.

739
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:10,833
Everyone is going to be so confused,
right?

740
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:16,125
After all, I've gone around
saying goodbye to everyone.

741
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:21,458
Nah.

742
01:29:24,708 --> 01:29:27,291
Who cares if they are confused?

743
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:29,791
You just won't be going.

744
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:33,750
You're not the center of the universe.

745
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,541
You can change your mind
whenever you want.

746
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:54,458
If I don't go, will you be happy?

747
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:02,291
Of course.

748
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,250
Can I hug you?

749
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:15,875
You're heavy.

750
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:20,791
Your hair stinks.

751
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,750
Let's go.

752
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,708
My daughter is going abroad.

753
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,500
I tried to stop her, but she won't listen.

754
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:26,583
So I want her
to say goodbye to her mother.

755
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:26,541
Where are you going, honey?

756
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:31,500
How are you, my dear?

757
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,750
I made an offering last month,

758
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:36,333
did you receive them?

759
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:45,583
The fish balls were delicious.

760
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:50,125
Sue is about to leave.

761
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,041
I couldn't stop her.

762
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:57,166
We have to let our daughter go.

763
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:01,541
She needs to live her own life.

764
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,833
Say hi to your mother.

765
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:21,666
Say goodbye to her, Sue.

766
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:32,375
What's wrong with you people?

767
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:39,166
Excuse me, sir.

768
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:42,875
I just don't buy this hogwash.

769
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:47,458
You can fool anyone you'd like.
But don't try to fool me.

770
01:34:53,625 --> 01:34:55,333
You haven't changed at all.

771
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:57,166
So headstrong.

772
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:01,166
Just like her mother.

773
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:05,333
This is insane!

774
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:14,250
Stop this nonsense!

775
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:20,166
Her heart was taken out of her body.

776
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:24,666
How could she be here?

777
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,250
Your wife has donated her
organs to the hospital.

778
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,666
Has the family been informed about this?

779
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,416
What do I have to do?

780
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:40,083
Actually, your signature

781
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:43,083
is already on the document as a witness.

782
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:47,083
You'll just have to sign the consent form
to allow the donation to proceed.

783
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:55,958
She forged my signature for sure.

784
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:03,750
Dad...

785
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:11,666
We would appreciate
if you could make a decision now.

786
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:15,458
It's a matter of life and
death for another patient.

787
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:26,083
-It's what your mother wanted.
-Dad...

788
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:27,541
Dad!

789
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:29,458
Dad! Don't do this!

790
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:32,166
Dad! No!

791
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,208
My body, my organs...

792
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,000
don't mean anything at all.

793
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:48,083
What remains is my spirit

794
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:51,666
that still watches over everyone.

795
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:54,291
This isn't funny.

796
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,958
I don't blame you.

797
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:05,875
It was me who told you...

798
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:11,125
that we both didn't belong in this place.

799
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:24,541
Have you closed the bank account?

800
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:29,333
I'm sorry

801
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:34,083
that I couldn't save up more for you.

802
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:44,541
This isn't right.

803
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:50,250
Yes, it's your mother.

804
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:55,125
No, this is not her.

805
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:07,000
Your heart is in another body.

806
01:38:09,166 --> 01:38:11,041
How could you be here?

807
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:36,541
Is it really you, Mom?

808
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:49,875
You said you'd be going to heaven.

809
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:54,500
Why did you come back?

810
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:03,083
I've been there, dear,

811
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,791
but then I realized

812
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:10,958
that I wasn't as happy in heaven
as when I was here.

813
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:14,291
So I came back.

814
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:17,625
To be with everyone.

815
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:22,416
Because I still care for all of you.

816
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:31,458
I found out that...

817
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:36,250
even though I never liked this place,

818
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:42,166
And I never felt like I belonged here,

819
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:47,041
There's no need to run away.

820
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:51,208
Why don't you try to make it better
right here?

821
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:12,041
I miss you, Mom.

822
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:17,625
I talk to you every night.

823
01:41:20,458 --> 01:41:22,250
Do you hear me?

824
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:24,791
Of course.

825
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:26,833
I hear you.

826
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:28,958
I hear Sun.

827
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:31,000
I hear your father.

828
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:34,041
I hear everybody.

829
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,375
Sue.

830
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:49,000
If you really want to go,

831
01:41:49,208 --> 01:41:51,125
I won't stop you.

832
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:59,208
I just hope that the new place
will truly become yours.

833
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:33,875
Mom...

834
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:42,166
I miss you.

835
01:43:05,916 --> 01:43:07,750
I've missed you, too.

836
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:28,666
I signed it.

837
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:07,750
I know how tough
the women in this family are.

838
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:14,083
Can I ask you one thing?

839
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:20,541
You have to come back.

840
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:11,458
RETURN COMIC BOOKS

841
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:14,458
EXCHANGE MONEY

842
01:47:14,541 --> 01:47:17,416
REUNITE STRATOSPHERE

843
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,500
SORT THINGS OUT WITH MEW

844
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:23,750
CONFESS MY FEELINGS TO KENG

845
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:27,041
TALK TO DAD

846
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:48,125
Check, please.

847
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,791
Sue. It's time for class.

848
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:02,833
Special discount 50 baht.

849
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:25,416
-Yesterday I...
-Learned.

850
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,083
Learned. Okay, let's just remember to...

851
01:48:29,166 --> 01:48:32,250
Keep the past tense in the assignments.

852
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:36,250
And I noticed that
there's still a little bit of a problem

853
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:38,708
With the past and present tense.

854
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,041
How was your class, Sue?

855
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:49,208
So so, not that bad.

856
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:53,875
How about Ja-ae?
I saw your romantic messages in Line.

857
01:48:54,333 --> 01:48:56,875
Don't be shy.

858
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:02,166
Tell me who he is.

859
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:05,791
-I saw you that day with someone.
-What did you see?

860
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:08,791
It's nothing special. Studying in Bangkok
you have to make some friends.

861
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:14,708
I'm still single.

862
01:49:47,208 --> 01:49:52,166
<i>What kind of adults will we grow up to be?</i>

863
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,083
<i>Aren't we grown-ups already?</i>

864
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:03,416
<i>No.</i>

865
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:09,583
<i>I'm talking about in ten, 20 years.</i>

866
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:22,791
<i>Maybe we'll grow up to become</i>
<i>the kind of adults that we used to hate.</i>

867
01:50:27,416 --> 01:50:29,833
<i>When we get to that point in life,</i>

868
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:34,916
<i>and think back about your old self</i>
<i>20 years ago,</i>

869
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,041
<i>I bet you won't remember much.</i>

870
01:51:31,708 --> 01:51:34,833
<i>Mr. David Gural,</i>
<i>an Australian science professor</i>

871
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:41,916
<i>aged 104, has arrived in Switzerland</i>
<i>with his family</i>

872
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,916
<i>and his favourite dog</i>
<i>to bid him final farewell.</i>

873
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,333
<i>Surrounded by reporters,</i>
<i>asking him about his intention to undergo </i>

874
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:55,416
<i>Euthanasia. Mr. Gural said he was glad</i>
<i>to have moved on to the final step.</i>

875
01:51:55,500 --> 01:52:01,000
<i>Before meeting with his doctor later today</i>
<i>and a press conference on Wednesday.</i>

876
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:05,833
Do you remember when
we were in 10th grade?

877
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,416
When I was punished?
It wasn't just me actually.

878
01:52:12,583 --> 01:52:17,250
All my friends ran away so
I had to take the blame.

879
01:52:19,166 --> 01:52:21,000
What a hero.

880
01:52:25,375 --> 01:52:28,375
I had a crush on you since that year.

881
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:44,625
Pull over.

882
01:54:45,416 --> 01:54:46,500
What's wrong?

883
01:54:52,083 --> 01:54:53,208
Hey, Sue?

884
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:02,083
-Who the fuck are you?
-Can you stop being a cunt?

885
01:55:02,166 --> 01:55:04,166
-What was that for?
-Why can't you be better.

886
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:06,708
Butt out! Fuck off, bitch!

887
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:09,083
Give me back my mother's heart!

888
01:55:09,333 --> 01:55:12,166
What the fuck are you talking about?

889
01:55:42,958 --> 01:55:45,333
Hey! Knock it off!

890
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:49,208
Are you okay?

891
01:55:52,208 --> 01:55:54,791
Can you get up?

892
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:33,750
You once told me

893
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:37,916
if it doesn't work,

894
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,458
I'll have to make it work.

895
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:54,083
I lied to you.

896
01:57:01,041 --> 01:57:03,041
It'll never work.

897
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:34,333
Where is Sue?
